# Webcam_Face_Detection

This Python script demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV. It captures video from your PC's webcam (or any other video source; we have to make slight changes in the code) and detects human faces. Detected faces are highlighted with rectangles. 

After cloning this repository, execute the camera.py file. Once you grant it access to your PC's webcam, the webcam will activate, and your face will be detected within a green bounding box. It employs a pre-defined Haarcascade .xml file for face detection. To close the webcam, simply press the 'q' key.
